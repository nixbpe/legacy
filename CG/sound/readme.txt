
			MindCode's OpenAL Lesson 1
			==========================

If you haven't downloaded the OpenAL32.dll yet you will have to or
else this demo will not work. If you haven't downloaded the libraries
for MinGW yet you won't be able to compile it yourself.

In this demo you'll have the option of playing/stopping the sound by
inputing the 'p' and 's' letters respectively, and to quit the program
by pushing the 'q' button.

When the source is playing you sould hear the voice saying hello to
you sarcasticly. (I bet you can't tell me who it is either :)
